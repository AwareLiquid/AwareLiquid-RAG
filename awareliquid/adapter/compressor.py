"""Dynamic context compression for token-metered question answering.

Retrieval narrows a long document down to a handful of chunks, but those chunks
are still verbose relative to what a single question needs. The compressor is
the token-saving stage: it keeps only the sentences within each retrieved chunk
that actually bear on the question, so the prompt sent to the generation model
is a fraction of the raw passages while still carrying every load-bearing fact.

The default strategy is *extractive* and runs entirely locally, so compression
itself costs zero generation tokens -- important when the score rewards token
efficiency. A sentence is scored by:

* lexical overlap with the question (shared content terms), and
* a salience bonus for numbers, percentages, currency and dates, which carry the
  facts financial questions turn on.

Sentences are then greedily packed into a character budget, highest score first,
and re-emitted in their original document order so local reasoning context is
preserved.
